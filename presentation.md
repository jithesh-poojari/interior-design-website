## üéØ **Project Title**

**DreamSpace ‚Äì Designing Warm and Cozy Interiors**

## üåø **Background / Problem Statement**

In today‚Äôs fast-paced urban life, most families are **nuclear** ‚Äî small households where people spend limited time together.
Because of this, **creating a home that feels warm, cozy, and emotionally comforting** has become more important than ever.

Many interior design websites focus on luxury or commercial designs, but **they often miss the emotional warmth** that smaller families or couples look for.
That‚Äôs where our project **DreamSpace** comes in.
